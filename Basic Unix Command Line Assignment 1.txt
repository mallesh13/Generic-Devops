Understand the output of command used in above question of displaying processes, explain the meaning of each column and what data it displays?

--> USER: which process running on which user
    PID: process Id for the perticular process
    %CPU: what is percentage of cpu utilization 
    %MEM: Percentage of memory used by the process

How to check all the command used from the prompt (Command History)

--> $ history

In which file the history of commands are stored in?

--> .bash_history

How many lines of history does the system keep and from where you can change it?

--> Numeric values less than zero result in every command being saved on the history list.
    The shell sets the default value to 500 after reading any startup files.
    if we want to change the limits goto ~/.bashhrc
    HISTSIZE,HISTFILESIZE set these values

How can you modify bash's history behaviour

Display all the commands entered so far, now, try to run a particular command from the history list without typing that command.

NOTE:- TAB key is your friend when it comes to command completion and having long file and directory names autocompleted at the bash prompt for you. JUST BE LAZY AND USE TAB KEY FOR AUTO COMPLETION ;-)
