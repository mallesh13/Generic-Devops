Objective:- Assignments will help trainees to understand the basics of unix command and how to explore and use it.

DO NOT copy paste commands from internet, you can take help of the Unix in-built command manual.

Be Honest to yourself!

Important command and option to learn unix commands:-
man Command
Example:-
man ls

--help Option
Example:-
ls --help

NOTE:- Always use "man" command before using any unix commands and read about it and its options and how to use it.

Assignments:-

List the contents of a directory and their attributes

 --> $ ls

Long list the content with file, directory ownership, permissions,sizes, etc…

 --> $ ls -l

Display the size of the file in human readable format

 --> $ ls -lh

Show all files and folders including hidden one

 --> $ ls -la

list directories recursively

--> $ ls -R

Sort the files by size with largest at the top

--> $ ls -lS

Sort the files by last time modified displaying the newest first.

--> $ ls -lt

Diplay the location of a program/command, where it is installed.

--> $ which <program name>

Which command is used to switch directory from one to another

--> $ cd <dir>

List all the environment variables set for the current shell environment

--> $ env

Did you notice something in the output of "env" command?

Which command is used to print the text or any variables value in the Console/Terminal?

--> $ echo

Print the value of the env variable "PATH" on the console

--> $ printenv PATH

Is linux a case-sensitive operating system?

--> yes

Is, "Ls" same as "ls"?

--> No

Display your currently logged in user

--> $ whoami

how do you change the currrently logged in user to another user?

--> su -l <username>
    enter password then it will change to another user 		

Which command is used to leave a shell environment that you are currently logged in to?

--> $ Ctrl+D or exit

How do you reboot the system?

--> $ reboot or sudo reboot(if you dont have sufficient privilages)

How do you shutdown the system?

--> $ sudo shutdown

Display all the major running processes in the system

--> $ ps -aux (a-select all processes, u-selects all processes of other users x-processes without controlling ttys)

Understand the output of command used in above question of displaying processes, explain the meaning of each column and what data it displays?

--> USER: which process running on which user
    PID: process Id for the perticular process
    %CPU: what is percentage of cpu utilization 
    %MEM: Percentage of memory used by the process
    TTY: specifies terminal number from (1-7)
    START: start date of the process
    TIME: at what time the process has started
    COMMAND: which command is used to start the process
	

Display the name of the system kernel

--> $ uname -s

display the kernel release number

--> $ uname -r

display teh machine type of the current kernel

--> $ uname -m

Display the name of the operating system that the kernel is running on

--> $ uname -o

Display all info that uname command can show.

--> $ uname -a

Display the name of directory that you are currently pointing to

--> $ pwd

change the current directory to another directory that you have in your system.

--> $ cd <path of another directory>

Go up one directory

--> $ cd ..

Return to last directory

--> $ cd -

change the current directory to home(logged in user's) directory

--> $ cd ~<username>

How to check all the command used from the prompt (Command History)

--> $ history

In which file the history of commands are stored in?

--> .bash_history

How many lines of history does the system keep and from where you can change it?

--> Numeric values less than zero result in every command being saved on the history list.
    The shell sets the default value to 500 after reading any startup files.
    if we want to change the limits goto ~/.bashhrc
    HISTSIZE,HISTFILESIZE set these values

How can you modify bash's history behaviour

Display all the commands entered so far, now, try to run a particular command from the history list without typing that command.

--> $ history
    $ !(sequence number of particular command)

NOTE:- TAB key is your friend when it comes to command completion and having long file and directory names autocompleted at the bash prompt for you. JUST BE LAZY AND USE TAB KEY FOR AUTO COMPLETION ;-)

What are the different types of shell and where are they used and how do we use them?

--> Bourne shell(sh): default shell for Solaris OS.it is also used as default shell for all Solaris system administration scripts.
		      it is preferred shell for shell programming bcz of its compactness and speed.
		* full path name is /bin/sh and /sbin/sh
		* default prompt for non-root user is $, root user is #
    C shell(csh): incorporated features for interactive use such as aliases and command history.
                  includes convenient programing features(built in arithmetic and C programming syntax)
		* full path name is /bin/csh
		* non root user is %, root user is #
    Korn shell(ksh): is a superset of bourne shell. supports everything in bourne shell
		     also includes convenient programming features like c shell. it is faster than c shell.
		     runs scripts written for bourne shell
		* command path name /bin/ksh
		* non root user $, root user #
    GNU Bourne-Again shell(bash): compatible to the bourne shell
				  incorporates usefull features like c shell and korn shell
				  has arrows key that are automatically mapped for command recall and edditing
		* command path name /bin/bash
		* non root user is bash-<shellversionnumber>$
		* root user is bash-<shellversionnumber>#

What is the difference between login shell and non-login shell?

--> if you open a shell or terminal if its asks credentials before it gives your a prompt, its a login shell
    if it doesnot, and you use straight away, its non login shell.

    $ echo $0
    o/p: -bash (login shell) 
	  bash (non login shell)


How do we start login shell and non-login shell?

--> In the sidebar select your current profile -> Select Command Under the Command label -> select Run command as a login shell.
   
What happens when you start a login shell (which files are read and used and Why)?

What happens when you start a non-login shell (Which files are read and used and Why)?

What are Shell Configuration Files, why do we need it?

--> shell configurations files are executed automatically when login and logout of shell.
    system wide configuration files(/etc/profile,/etc/bashrc)
    user configuration files(~/.bash_profile,~/.bash_login,~/.bash_logout)

Explain the Order of file usage from the system/user's home directory when user logs in to the System.

--> create a file( touch)
    listing files (ls)
    view file and modify (cat)
    file type (file)
    copying file (cp)
    moving and renamming(mv)
    deleting file (rm)

What are Shell Variables, list major shell variables and what do they represent?

--> shell variable is a special variable that is set by the shell and is reqguired by the shell in order to function correctly. some of the variables are 
    environment varibles others are local varibles.
    $HOME - home directory path
    $PATH - list of directories to search commands
    $USER - user name
    

How we see all our env variables?

--> $ printenv

How we see all env variables in alphabical order?

--> $ printenv | sort

What Format does the env var and its values are stored?

How do you create your own varible?

--> $ n=10
    $ echo $n
    10

How do you start a new bash shell?

--> goto the folder where you want to open bash shell. in address bar type bash and enter. 

Difference between Local/Shell variables to Global Variable

--> local/shell variables are visible in the shell where it was defined
    global variables are visible for any running process that runs from shell

Making a variable accessible from other the shell in the system.

Show the real life use case of exporting a variable

--> $ car=audi
    $ export car
    $ printenv car
    o/p: audi

Convert the above script file into a command, The file should run with "myappp" instead of "myapp.sh"

What is Globbing? Explain in depth with examples?

--> globbing is an operation that recognizes the wildcard pattern and expands it into its path name
    wildcards pattern are charecters like ?,*,[ . it perform action on more than one file having same pattern

    ex: office.*
	the result of this search is set of all file names that exist in storage medium with office.to leftof the period
	such as office.txt,office.ppt,office.docs, office.imge ......

List all entries with extension ".sh"

--> find -type f \( -name "*.sh" \) 
		or
    ls *.sh

List all entries with numbers in it.

--> ls *+([0-9])*

List all entries that starts with a character and ends with a number

--> ls [a-z]*[0-9]

List all entries that name length more than 5 characters
What is Quoting? and Why do we need it?

-->Quoting is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or words to the shell. 
   it can be used to disable special treatment for special characters, to prevent reserved words from being recognized as such,
   and to prevent parameter expansion.
   there are 3 quoting machanisms
	escape charecter : how to remove special meaning from single charecter.
	single quotes: how to inhibit all interpretation of sequence of charecters.
	double quotes: how to suppress most of the interpretation of a sequence of characters.

Write few(minimum 3) unique examples that shows, how a particular problem is solved using Quoting.

--> $ echo hello; word        $ echo hello\; word   (escape charecter)
    o/p: hello		      o/p: hello; word
	 word:not found

    $ var=hello
    $ echo '$var hello <-$1500 **> & ;( ^ done'     (single quotes)
    o/p: $var hello <-$1500 **> & ;( ^ done

    $ VAR=ZARA
    $ echo "$VAR owes <-\$1500.**>; [ as of (`date +%m/%d`) ]"		(double quotes)
    o/p: ZARA owes <-$1500.**>; [ as of (10/06) ]
    

How do you find a particular files/directories based on a particular search criteria?
HINT:- look for commands -> locate, find and whereis

--> $ find -name \<files/directory>

Write major difference between locate, find and whereis?

--> whereis: will search only particular paths.
    find : will search real files recursively down a given directory
    locate: will search database without requiring specific directory
	if you have saved a file before updating database, find will find it, but locate won't.

How Globbing is different from locate, find and whereis?

--> using globbing used to match the filenames or serching the content in a file. whereis, find, locate used for only files/directories

Explain the Linux File System.

--> structured collection of files on a disk drive or a partition.
    linux file system is generally a built-in layer of a Linux operating system used to handle the data management of the storage.
    it helps to arrange the file on the disk storage. It manages the file name, file size, creation date, and much more information about a file.
    linux file system has a hierarchal file structure as it contains a root directory and its subdirectories. 
    all other directories can be accessed from the root directory

		        kernel
		 virtual file system
	EXT3	HPFS	VFAT	EXT4	FreeBSD
			hardware

Explain absolute and Relative Paths

--> absolute path: location of a file/directory from the root directory(/)
		ex:/etc/hello.cong
    relative path: path related to present working directory(pwd)
		ex: pwd/new

What are the different ways of creating a File in linux System? Write an example of each and the difference between them.

--> touch:   easiest way to create a new file
		 $ touch hello.txt   (it will create empty file)
    >  : the system to output results into whatever you specify next. The target is usually a filename. 
	 You can use this symbol by itself to create a new file
		$ > file.txt   (creates a new empty file)
   cat: It can be used to output the contents of several files, one file, or even part of a file.
	 if the file doesn’t exist, the linux cat command will create it.
		$ cat > cat.txt 
   echo : whatever specified in command and puts a copy into a file
		$ echo "echo file creat" > echo.txt
   printf : works like echo command and its add some formatting functionality
		$ printf "first\n second" > prin.txt
			first
			second
   vi : oldest text editor in linux. directly editing text files
		$ vi new.txt    (to save and exit press esc:x)
   nano: is newer and much easier text editor to navigate
		$ nano nano1.txt    (ctrl+o to save the changes, ctrl+x exit editor)
	   
In how many ways we can delete the files from linux system? write an example of each and teh difference between them.

--> unlink: used to delete single file
		$ uplink filename
    rm: used to delete single file or multiple files
		$ rm filename1 filename2

Archiving files using linux command, write a command to archive set of files from linux commands.

--> $ tar cf <name>.tar file1 file2 file3    (c-creation of new archive, f-specified archive file)

Extract the archived files from the above step.
 
--> $ tar xf <name>.tar  (x- extract archive , t-list of contents of archive
