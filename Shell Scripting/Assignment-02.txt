Write a script that sets FOUR variables:

MYUSERNAME
MYPASSWORD
STARTOFSCRIPT
ENDOFSCRIPT

Populate the first two with some default value and use command redirection to set the third and fourth value to the date/time of when the script was started and completed. Within the script, be sure to display the values to the terminal when run.


-------------------------------------

#!/bin/bash
MYUSERNAME="mallesh"
MYPASSWORD="mallesh1122"
STARTOFSCRIPT=`date`
echo $MYUSERNAME
echo $MYPASSWORD
echo "start : $STARTOFSCRIPT"
ENDOFSCRIPT=`date`
echo "end: $ENDOFSCRIPT"
