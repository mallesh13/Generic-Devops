Create a script that interacts with the user. You will want to prompt the user to enter the following information (which you will capture and place into the following variables):

FIRSTNAME
LASTNAME
USERAGE

Greet the user with their name and current age displayed and then calculate and display their age in 10 years.

---------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash

read -p "enter firstname :" FIRSTNAME
read -p "enter lastname:" LASTNAME
read -p "enter age:" USERAGE

echo "welcome to $FIRSTNAME $LASTNAME"
echo $USERAGE

newage=$(($USERAGE+10))
echo ""age in 10 years: $newage"
