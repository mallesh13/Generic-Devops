Create a simple script that does the following:

Echo a full sentence to the terminal
Echo a different full sentence, but redirect it to /dev/null

Run and display the results and make sure the statements appear where intended.


-------------------------------

#!/bin/bash

echo "first sentence"
echo "second sentence">>/dev/null    

#/dev/null called bit-bucket or blackhole.it immediately dicards anything written to it
